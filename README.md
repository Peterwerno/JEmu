This project is a Java emulator for various retro computer systems from Z80 and 6502 processor-based models such as the Sinclair or Commodore computers to some very special items such as 1980s digital watches, etc.

I used NetBeans 8.0 for the development, so when downloading the project using the same IDE, you should be able to immediately compile and run the emulator from your IDE.
